# Visual Guide to Composite Animations

This guide provides a visual description of how each composite animation works and what makes it unique.

## 1. Plasma → Lissajous

### Concept
A Lissajous curve whose shape continuously morphs as it's driven by the undulating plasma field beneath it.

```

### What Makes It Special
- The curve never settles into a single shape
- Creates organic, living patterns
- Frequencies vary in opposite directions (when one increases, other decreases)
- Plasma waves create slow, hypnotic morphing

### Best Viewing
- Watch for 30+ seconds to see full morphing cycle
- Notice how curve complexity increases and decreases
- Look for moments when it forms simple circles vs. complex flowers

## 2. Flux → Spiral

### Concept
A spiral that spins faster when fluid waves are active, slower during calm periods - as if being "pushed" by invisible water.

### Visual Description
```

```

### What Makes It Special
- Direct visual feedback of wave energy
- Spiral appears to "respond" to invisible forces
- Pulsing rhythm creates a sense of life
- Can see correlation between rain drops and spin speed

### Best Viewing
- Watch the spiral during a heavy rain period
- Notice how it "catches" wave energy and spins up
- Observe the slow-down during calm periods
- The effect is like a water wheel being turned by a stream

## 3. Lissajous → Plasma

### Concept
Plasma field whose color waves are synchronized to the smooth oscillation of a Lissajous curve.

```

### What Makes It Special
- Harmonic relationship between curve motion and color waves
- Creates synchronized, psychedelic patterns
- Plasma "breathes" in time with the curve
- Mathematical beauty of coupled oscillators

### Best Viewing
- Watch the plasma colors shift as curve moves
- Notice the correlation between curve position and wave speed
- Beautiful when frequencies are in harmonic ratios (2:3, 3:4, etc.)
- Creates a sense of "pulsing" field

## Modulation Strength Examples

### Low Strength (0.3x)
```
Subtle effect - parameters change slightly
Good for backgrounds or ambient displays
```

### Medium Strength (1.0x)
```
Balanced - clear modulation without chaos
Default setting, recommended for most uses
```

### High Strength (1.5x)
```
Dramatic changes - parameters swing widely
Creates intense, chaotic visuals
Use for maximum visual impact
```

### Very High Strength (2.0x)
```
Extreme modulation - can become unpredictable
May produce artifacts or too-fast changes
Experimental setting
```

## Animation Cycles

Each composite has natural cycles:

### Plasma → Lissajous
- **Period**: ~10-15 seconds
- **Pattern**: Simple → Complex → Simple
- **Watch for**: Moments of perfect circles and intricate flowers

### Flux → Spiral
- **Period**: Variable (depends on rain rate)
- **Pattern**: Calm → Wave → Spin → Calm
- **Watch for**: Correlation between visible drops and rotation

### Lissajous → Plasma
- **Period**: ~8-12 seconds
- **Pattern**: Fast waves → Slow waves → Fast waves
- **Watch for**: Perfect synchronization between curve and colors

---

## Troubleshooting Visual Issues

### "I don't see any modulation"
- Increase modulation strength (Param 1)
- Check that source animation has variation
- Some parameter ranges produce stable outputs

### "Too chaotic/random"
- Decrease modulation strength
- Use quadratic or sine mapping for smoother transitions
- Reduce source animation parameters

### "Looks jerky/stuttering"
- Performance issue - composites are CPU intensive
- Try running plasma-based targets at lower quality
- Close other applications

### "Colors are wrong"
- This is normal - composites create unexpected color patterns
- Try different modulation mappings
- Some combinations work better than others

---

## Fun Experiments to Try

1. **Find Resonance**: Adjust plasma frequencies to match Lissajous frequencies
2. **Create Chaos**: Set flux to maximum rain rate and watch spiral go wild
3. **Harmonic Sync**: Set Lissajous to 2:3 frequency ratio, watch plasma sync
4. **Slow Motion**: Reduce modulation strength to 0.2x for subtle effects
5. **Hyperactive**: Crank everything to maximum for sensory overload

---

## Technical Notes

### Frame Rate Impact
- Source animation complexity affects performance
- Target rendering determines FPS ceiling
- Plasma targets are slowest (full-screen render)
- Lissajous targets are fastest (sparse points)

### Memory Usage
- Composites use ~2x memory (two animations)
- Fluid lattice has largest memory footprint
- Not significant on modern systems

### Precision
- All values internally use float64 for precision
- Modulation values normalized to [-1.0, 1.0]
- Mapping preserves precision through range conversion
